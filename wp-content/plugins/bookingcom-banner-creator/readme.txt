With the Booking.com Banner Creator plug-in, you can make attractive, profitable banners for your website and start earning commission.

== Description ==

It’s never been easier to create a personalised banner that matches the design of your site and engages your audience. 

The Banner Creator is easily customisable to your needs, your audience and the devices they use. You can create a banner from any image* you want, or choose from six beautiful photos inspired by the most popular themes on Booking.com. Then just enter a clear call-to-action and you’re ready to go!

Once you’re done creating it, you’ll need to track the reservations it brings in. The Banner Creator makes tracking simple. Once you attach a label to the banner, the Partner Center Individual Bookings Performance report will clearly show you which reservations have come through the banner.

*Minimum 1920px to ensure the best image quality*

*To activate tracking, you will need to enable the ‘Label’ column in the report*
